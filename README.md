# Introduction
This is a head-only libary for c++ to easily control path of dir and file like os.path in Python.

# Compiler version
The libary should be compiled by a modern c++ compiler (gcc,clang,etc.), and now it is ONLY useful in Linux.

The support of Windows is on the way. 

# To do
As you can see, the libary is not complete. I need some time to finish it.
